# Introduction to scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.  

To use scikit-learn you must import the following packages:

- `NumPy`: N dimensional base matrix library
- `pandas`: Data structure and analysis
- `sCIPY`: Fundamental to scientific mathematics
- `matplotlib`: Complete 2D layout
- `IP[y]`: Enhanced interactive dashboard
- `SymPy`: Symbolic mathematics

## Supervised learning algorithms

The vast majority of the machine learning algorithms that enter into the classification of supervised learning are part of scikit-learn such as `Linear regression`, `SVM`, `decision trees` and `Bayesian methods`.

## Unsupervised learning algorithms

This library has a wide variety of algorithms available such as `clustering`, `factor analysis`, `principal component analysis` and `unsupervised neural networks`

## Cross validation

There are several methods to verify the accuracy of the models, and this library has the instructions to implement them.

## Several datasets or datasets

It makes available several datasets that are very useful to practice the knowledge of machine learning.

## Extraction and selection of characteristics

It is very useful for extracting features from images and text, as well as being able to identify significant attributes.
